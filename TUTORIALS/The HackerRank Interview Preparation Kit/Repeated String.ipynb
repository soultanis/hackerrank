    "## Task\n",
    "Lilah has a string, $s$, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, $n$, find and print the number of letter a's in the first $n$ letters of Lilah's infinite string. For example, if the string $s= 'abcac' $ and $n=10$, the substring we consider is $'abcacabcac'$, the first $10$ characters of her infinite string. There are $4$ occurrences of a in the substring.\n",
